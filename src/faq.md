## the app

&nbsp;

### how does it work?

#### 1. take the compatibility test
we'll score your compatibility with others based on your personality, interests & values.

#### 2. get a notification when your next match walks nearby
you both can see your compatibility and have 5 minutes to respond.

#### 3. go and say hi!
if you both press "meet up", you can temporarily chat & share your locations to spontaneously find each other and say hi.&nbsp;

&nbsp;


### how close do we need to be to get matched?

you‚Äôll only be matched with people in walking distance from you‚Äîmostly less than 500 feet away.

&nbsp;

### i signed up and took the test. now what?

just make sure your status is ‚Äúactive‚Äù and you‚Äôre good to go! live your life and let the app do the work in the background.

as you walk around, you might suddenly get a notification that someone highly compatible for you is around the corner. if you‚Äôre down, just press ‚Äúmeet up!‚Äù

&nbsp;

### please tell me there‚Äôs a cute notification sound that plays when i get matched?

omg how did you know

&nbsp;

### i just got matched and I want to meet them but i‚Äôm running late to class üò≠

is love more important than grades? are they worth it?

that‚Äôs up for you to decide.

seriously though, we‚Äôd be happy to explain any tardiness to your prof if you were busy connecting with someone through sc dating club. just text us at 615 975 4270

&nbsp;

### oh my god, we both said ‚Äúyes‚Äù to meeting up. now what!

this is where things get exciting!

you and your match will both have 5 minutes to find each other and say hi.

at any time, you can end the match and location sharing will stop.

&nbsp;

### i‚Äôm looking like shit today and don‚Äôt wanna be matched‚Ä¶

dw, we‚Äôve been there too.

if you don‚Äôt want to be matched with anyone for some time, you can always become inactive.

on the home screen, press the ‚Äúactive‚Äù button to toggle your status between active and inactive.

just make sure to turn your status back to ‚Äúactive‚Äù once you‚Äôre down to start meeting new people again ;)

&nbsp;

### why do i need to enable location and notifications?

well, they‚Äôre both essential for the app to work.

your location is updated as you walk around so you can find out if you walk by someone who‚Äôs just for you.

notifications are necessary because all matches are spontaneous‚Äîyou both only get a few minutes to respond.

&nbsp;

### what happens with my location data btw?

we take privacy very seriously.

your test responses & location data is encrypted and only used to find your next match. all location data is deleted within 24 hours, and no data is shared under any circumstances. 

learn more in our **[privacy policy](scdatingclub.com/privacy)**.

&nbsp;

### will the app affect my phone‚Äôs battery life?

we use newly released Apple APIs to keep battery usage to a minimum. through our tests, we couldn‚Äôt detect any effect the app had on battery life. 

&nbsp;

### when **will it be available on Android?**

our app is powered by Apple‚Äôs new APIs. unfortunately, these are unavailable on Android, so we don‚Äôt have a release date at this time.
